Summary:
The Beige Book provides an overview of economic activity in the United States as of November 2023. Overall, economic growth slowed across the country, with four districts reporting modest growth, two indicating flat to slightly down conditions, and six noting slight declines in activity. Key financial highlights include:

• Consumer spending was mixed, with sales of discretionary and durable goods like furniture and appliances declining on average as consumers became more price-sensitive.

• Manufacturing activity was mixed, with some manufacturers experiencing sharp revenue declines from a year earlier. Manufacturers' outlooks weakened.

• Demand for business loans decreased slightly, particularly for real estate loans.

• Consumer credit remained fairly healthy overall, but some banks noted a slight uptick in consumer delinquencies.

• Residential home sales were flat at very low levels due to high mortgage rates. Commercial real estate activity continued to slow, with the office segment remaining weak.

• Price increases largely moderated across districts, though prices remained elevated overall.

• The economic outlook for the next 6-12 months diminished over the reporting period.
